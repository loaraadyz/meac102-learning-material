    <section class="history">
        <h2>History and Applications</h2>
        <p>One of the most noteworthy aspects of electronics is how little the fundamental principles have changed over time. Systems have become smaller and faster, and new gadgets emerge daily, yet most devices in use today are based on concepts and designs developed decades ago.</p>
        <p>In 1958, Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments developed the first integrated circuit (IC), a groundbreaking invention that revolutionized electronics. Today, modern ICs, like the Intel&reg; Core&trade; i7 Extreme Edition Processor, contain billions of transistors within a small package. This rapid miniaturization demonstrates the industry's relentless drive for innovation, while the underlying principles remain unchanged.</p>
        <p>Miniaturization faces four main limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Semiconductor Material Quality</li>
            <li>Network Design Techniques</li>
            <li>Manufacturing and Processing Equipment</li>
            <li>Innovative Spirit in the Industry</li>
        </ul>
