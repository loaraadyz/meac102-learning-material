        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> This course discusses the construction, operation, and characteristics of basic electronics devices such as PN junction diode, light emitting diode, Zener diode, Bipolar Junction Transistor, and Field Effect Transistor. Diode circuit applications such as clipper, clamper, and switching diode circuits will be a part of the lecture. Operation of a DC regulated power supply as well as analysis of BJT and FET amplifier circuits will be tackled. This course also discusses the operation and characteristics of operational amplifiers (CHED CMO. 12 s. 2017).</p>
        <p>This course aligns with <strong>SDG 4</strong> (Quality Education) by fostering foundational knowledge and technical skills in electronics to promote inclusive and equitable quality education. It also supports <strong>SDG 7</strong> (Affordable and Clean Energy) through its focus on energy-efficient devices, such as DC regulated power supplies and amplifiers, promoting sustainable energy solutions. Additionally, it contributes to <strong>SDG 9</strong> (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by equipping learners with industry-relevant skills that drive innovation and support the development of sustainable infrastructure.</p>
