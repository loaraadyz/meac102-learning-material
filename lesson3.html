            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Imagine a world without smartphones, computers, or even LED lights. None of these would exist without one fundamental component: the PN junction diode. Despite being one of the simplest electronic devices, its invention revolutionized technology and laid the foundation for modern electronics.</p>
            <p>In this lesson, we will explore the PN junction diode, a device that controls the flow of electrical current in one direction, paving the way for numerous applications—from rectifiers in power supplies to the vibrant LEDs we see in everyday devices. You’ll gain an understanding of how this small but mighty component is constructed, how it operates, and its significance in electronic circuits.</p>

            <h2>1. Construction and Operation of a PN Junction Diode</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Construction</h3>
            <p>A <strong>PN junction diode</strong> is formed by joining a <strong>P-type semiconductor</strong> (positive) and an <strong>N-type semiconductor</strong> (negative).</p>
            <ul>

                    <img src="images/pnjunction.png" alt="PN-Junction Diode Illustration">
                </div>
                <li><strong>P-type region:</strong> Contains an excess of holes (positive charge carriers).</li>
                <li><strong>N-type region:</strong> Contains an excess of electrons (negative charge carriers).</li>
                <li>The junction where the P-type and N-type meet is called the <strong>depletion region</strong>, which acts as a barrier to charge carriers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Operation</h3>
            <div class="diagram-container">
                <img src="images/biased.png" alt="Forward and Reverse Bias Illustration">
            </div>
            <p><strong>Forward Bias:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the positive terminal of a voltage source is connected to the P-side and the negative terminal to the N-side, the depletion region becomes narrower, allowing current to flow.</li>
                <li>Electrons move from the N-side toward the P-side, and holes move from the P-side toward the N-side.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Reverse Bias:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the positive terminal is connected to the N-side and the negative terminal to the P-side, the depletion region widens, preventing current flow (except for a tiny leakage current).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.3 Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Used for <strong>rectification</strong> in power supplies.</li>
                <li>Found in circuits for <strong>signal modulation, demodulation</strong>, and <strong>voltage regulation</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The PN junction diode is fundamental to electronics, with applications in rectification, voltage regulation, and light emission. Understanding its construction, operation, and analysis forms the foundation for exploring advanced semiconductor devices.</p>
