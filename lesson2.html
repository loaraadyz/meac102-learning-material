        <h2>Introduction to Electrical Conductivity </h2>
        <p>Electrical conductivity is a fundamental concept in electronics that determines how well a material allows electric current to flow through it. Every material we encounter—from the copper wires in our homes to the rubber soles of our shoes—has unique electrical properties. Understanding these properties is crucial in designing and operating electronic systems.</p>

        <h2>Energy Band Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Energy Band Theory is essential to understanding why materials behave as conductors, insulators, or semiconductors. 
            The theory explains how electrons occupy specific energy levels in a material, which influences its electrical properties.

        <div class="band-comparison-container">
            <div class="band-category">
                <h3>Conductors</h3>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The valence band overlaps with the conduction band, allowing electrons to flow easily, resulting in high conductivity.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Metals like copper and silver exhibit this overlapping structure, making them excellent conductors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="band-category">
                <h3>Insulators</h3>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A wide energy gap exists between the valence band and the conduction band, preventing electron flow and resulting in poor conductivity.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Materials like rubber and glass have this large energy gap, making them effective insulators.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="band-category">
                <h3>Semiconductors</h3>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A narrow energy gap allows electrons to jump to the conduction band with sufficient energy, enabling controlled conductivity.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Silicon and germanium are widely used semiconductors that can be "doped" to enhance conductivity.</p>
