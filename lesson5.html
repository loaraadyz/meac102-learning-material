            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>A DC regulated power supply ensures a stable voltage output for electronic circuits by converting AC to DC and regulating fluctuations. It consists of key components such as a transformer, rectifier, filter, and voltage regulator. The transformer steps down AC voltage, the rectifier converts it to DC, the filter smooths out fluctuations, and the voltage regulator maintains a steady output. This type of power supply is widely used in powering microcontrollers, testing circuits, charging batteries, and industrial automation. Understanding its function and troubleshooting common issues—such as incorrect voltage output or overheating components—is essential for electronics applications.</p>
