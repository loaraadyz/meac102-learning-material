                    <p>1.	A DC power supply provides 500V at no load, but the output voltage decreases to 400V when the full load is applied. Calculate the percentage voltage regulation of the power supply.</p>
                    <p>2.	A power supply has a voltage regulation of 2%. If the no-load output voltage is 50V, what is the full-load voltage of the power supply?</p>
                    <p>3.	You have two power supplies, X and Y.

                    <p>6.	If the no-load output voltage of a DC power supply is 200V and the output voltage decreases to 180V when a full load of 10A is applied, calculate the voltage regulation of the power supply.</p>
                    <p>7.	A power supply has a voltage regulation of 3%. If the no-load voltage is 25V, calculate the voltage under full load.</p>
                    <p>8.	The output voltage of a DC power supply decreases from 18V to 17.5V as a load current increases from 4A to 5A. Calculate the output impedance of the power supply.</p>
                    <p>9.	Two DC power supplies, P1 and P2, have the following characteristics:

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>A DC regulated power supply ensures a stable voltage output for electronic circuits by converting AC to DC and regulating fluctuations. It consists of key components such as a transformer, rectifier, filter, and voltage regulator. The transformer steps down AC voltage, the rectifier converts it to DC, the filter smooths out fluctuations, and the voltage regulator maintains a steady output. This type of power supply is widely used in powering microcontrollers, testing circuits, charging batteries, and industrial automation. Understanding its function and troubleshooting common issues—such as incorrect voltage output or overheating components—is essential for electronics applications.</p>
